Bioinformatics Pipelines

## Introduction
<p align="justify"> This application makes RNA-Seq analysis: quality control, pre-processing, alignment, transcript quantification and differential expression analysis on BAM files. Given the input files and the working directory, the pipeline is completely automated. First, quality control on fastq files is performed with FastQC e FastQ Screen. FastQC makes quality control and creates one report for sample. FastQ Screen estimates approximately the percentage of reads that can be mapped on genomes other than human, like ribosomal genome, phix genome and mouse genome. This allows to evaluate the presence of contaminating genomes. Pre-processing follows quality control: the reads are aligned on phix genome and ribosomal genome to eliminate contaminations. Alignment can be performed with TopHat or HISAT2; in the first case quantification is performed with Cufflinks and DEA with cummeRbund, in the second case quantification is performed with featureCounts and DEA with DESeq2 or edgeR. A second intermediate quality control analysis is also performed on the aligned BAM files with some of the RSeQC scripts and in particular: inner_distance, junction_annotation, junction_saturation, bam_stat, read_distribution, geneBody_coverage. It is possible to perform an optional meta-analysis on the results. It consists in Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and KEGG Pathway enrichment analysis on the differentially expressed genes (with absolute Fold Change value higher than 1.5 and adjusted p-value lower than 0.05). </p>

### Input files
*	<p align="justify">Fastq files of the samples. Since this is a differential analysis, at least one case and one control must be present, furthermore if it is a paired-end analysis files of read 1 and read 2 must be provided for each sample while if it is a single-end analysis only files of read 1 must be provided.</p>
*	<p align="justify">Reference genome for Bowtie with relative indices, necessary for alignment with TopHat. The path in which the file with its indices is searched by default is as follows: /opt/genome/human/hg19/index/bowtie2/hg19.</p>
